## Overview
This project is how you go about to make a simple "real-time" baby monitor. It measures 2 different temperatures, humidity and has sound detection (for the screams). It dsplays current values as well as monitoring if the sound i high over time. This is a beginners to intermediate project and the estimated time needed to complete this project following this tutorial is 3-4 hours.

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to be able to monitor your baby when its sleeping in a stroller. This will be done by using two different temperature sensor (outside temp and the temp close to the baby), humidity and sound detection in real-time, (this also monitors if a high sound is detected over time, so we could rule out a sudden sound).

A microcontroller and 3 different sensors is used to collect data. This data is transmitted through an MQTT server and displayed on the internet.

## Material

In this project we will work with the Raspberry Pi Pico WH microcontroller. It offers both digital and analog input and output. It's super tiny, and it is has a WiFi intecface. For detailed information about the Pico W, check out the [datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/pico-w-datasheet.pdf).

To measure temperatures and humidity we will use DHT11 Humidity and Temperature Sensor, The MCP9700 analog thermistor and KY-038 Sound detector sensor.

We also need a breadboard and some jumpers to connect everything, and a micro-USB cable to connect to our computer, this will also second as a power source.

## Computer setup
This will work on a Windows, Mac or Linux machine, just be sure to download the right software for for your OS.

* For IDE we use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * with the extension [PyMakr](https://github.com/pycom/pymakr-vsc/blob/HEAD/GET_STARTED.md) (which is used to upload code to the Pico WH.
  * To use the extension we also need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

### Installation steps

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you don't already have it installed.
2. Download and install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Get the current version, not the LTS.
3. Download and install the IDE [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
4. Install [PyMakr](https://github.com/pycom/pymakr-vsc/blob/HEAD/GET_STARTED.md) via the extension marketplace inside VS Code.
5. Update the firmware on your Raspberry Pi Pico:
   In order:
   * Download The [MicroPython firmware](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico-w/). This is a **uf2** file. Get the latest from **Releases**, not ~~Nightly builds~~.
   * Connect the micro-USB cable to the Raspberry Pi Pico.
   * While holding the **BOOTSEL** button down on the board, connect the other end of the USB cable to your computer. After plugging it in you can release the button.
   * A new drive should appear in your file system named **RPI-RP2**, this is the Raspberry Pi Pico storage. Just drag and drop the **uf2**, you downloaded earlier, into this storage. This will install micropython on your Raspberry Pi Pico.
   * Wait for the board to automatically disconnect and reconnect (should take less than a minute).
   * If you are using a Linux machine you need to do the following extra steps:
      * **Debian/Fedora**: enter this command into the terminal ``sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER ``
      * **Arch**: enter the following command into the terminal
        ``sudo usermod -a -G uucp $USER``

## Putting everything together
This image illustrates how to connect the DHT11, MCP9700, and KY-038 to your Raspberry Pi Pico WH using a piece of bread.

## Platform
For this project the choice of platform falls on **adafruit**. It is free and easy to use for beginners. It also offers some simple visuals for presenting your data.

 * First we need to set up an account at [adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com)
 * Next we create 4 feeds, one for each sensor, exception is the DHT11, which requires two feeds, one for temperature and one for humidity.
 * Instructions on how to set up feeds can be found on adafruits [basic-feeds tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io-basics-feeds).
