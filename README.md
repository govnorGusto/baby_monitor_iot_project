## Overview
This project is how you go about to make a simple "real-time" baby monitor. It measures 2 different temperatures, humidity and has sound detection (for the screams). It dsplays current values as well as monitoring if the sound i high over time. This is a beginners to intermediate project and the estimated time needed to complete this project following this tutorial is 3-4 hours.

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to be able to monitor your baby when its sleeping in a stroller. This will be done by using two different temperature sensor (outside temp and the temp close to the baby), humidity and sound detection in real-time, (this also monitors if a high sound is detected over time, so we could rule out a sudden sound).

A microcontroller and 3 different sensors is used to collect data. This data is transmitted through an MQTT server and displayed on the internet.

## Material

In this project we will work with the Raspberry Pi Pico WH microcontroller. It offers both digital and analog input and output. It's super tiny, and it is has a WiFi intecface. For detailed information about the Pico W, check out the [datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/pico-w-datasheet.pdf).

To measure temperatures and humidity we will use DHT11 Humidity and Temperature Sensor, The MCP9700 analog thermistor and KY-038 Sound detector sensor.

We also need a breadboard and some jumpers to connect everything, and a micro-USB cable to connect to our computer, this will also second as a power source.
